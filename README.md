# FCC_Certifications
My works on freecodecamp and certifications practices. I'll post some of practices exercices but no all of them. If you do not know what is fCC, in short : it's a great free platform where you can earn you very own web & programing certifications according a 10 ou 12-levels journey. You do not really need to install anything, just sign up and follow the lead.
